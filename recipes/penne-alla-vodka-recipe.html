    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Penne</li><li>Olive Oil</li><li>Onion</li><li>Butter</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Vodka</li><li>Tomato Paste</li><li>Heavy Cream</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil Water</li><li>Add oil and butter to a skiller over medium heat. aut√© the onion for about 5 minutes or until softened (ok if it lightly browns)</li>
                <li>Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds</li><li>Add the vodka and let the sauce bubble for 30 seconds or so</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato paste until you've got a smooth mixture</li><li>Stir in the cream, and reduce heat to medium-low. Let the sauce warm through. I find this sauce thickens up very quickly (within a couple minutes), but feel free to cook it a little longer to thicken it up even more.</li>
                <li>Season with salt & pepper as needed. Stir in the fresh basil if using. Toss with the drained pasta (if needed, thin the sauce out a bit with a splash of hot pasta water prior to draining it). Serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
            </ol>
